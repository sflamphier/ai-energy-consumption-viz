# AI Energy Consumption Visualization

An interactive data visualization project exploring the energy consumption and environmental impact of AI systems compared to traditional search methods.

## Overview

This project aims to educate users about:
- Energy consumption differences between AI-powered queries and traditional search methods
- Real-world equivalents of abstract energy metrics 
- Monetary costs associated with AI energy consumption
- Actionable steps to reduce AI energy footprints

## Features

- Interactive Tableau visualizations throughout
- Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewing
- Smooth scrolling navigation between sections
- Exploration of different query complexities and their energy impacts
- Comparison of sustainability practices across providers

## Technologies Used

- React with TypeScript
- Tableau visualizations (embedded)
- Tailwind CSS
- Express (backend)
- Shadcn UI components
